# CoNfects

This package is a collection of fairly common and standard UI components I was finding myself constantly redefining in projects.
So, instead of that, I decided to make a dedicated library of them all.

This relies on my SCSS styling package `confetti`, which defines things like flex displays, theme coloring, and element styling.
